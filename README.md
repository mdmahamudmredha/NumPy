Introduction to the NumPy library — its purpose, importance, and role in scientific computing.

### ⏰ 07:52 What is a Library?

Explanation of what a Python library is, its structure (library > package > module > function/class), and how NumPy fits into this hierarchy.

### ⏰ 32:20 Why NumPy?

Reasons for choosing NumPy over Python list or array — performance, multidimensional support, broadcasting, vectorized operations.

### ⏰ 34:35 Standard Python Arrays (List, array.array)

Overview of how array-like structures work in standard Python without external libraries.

### ⏰ 39:56 Python List vs NumPy Array vs array.array

Detailed comparative analysis with examples and code:

* Data Type Consistency
* Mathematical Operation Support
* Speed
* Memory Efficiency
* Multi-dimensional Support

### ⏰ 46:58 Scalar, Vector, Matrix, Tensor

What are these structures? Why are they important in math, ML, and deep learning?

### ⏰ 49:52 Real-Life Examples of Scalar, Vector, Matrix, Tensor

Practical scenarios where these data structures are used:

* Grayscale image
* RGB image
* Student marksheet
* Weather data

### ⏰ 53:43 Starting with NumPy Functions

How to start coding with NumPy and what you'll need to know first.

### ⏰ 54:21 How to Import NumPy

Proper ways to import NumPy using aliases and best practices.

Basic array creation methods:

```python
np.array([...])
```

### ⏰ 1:05:18 Placeholder Arrays in NumPy (Initial Templates)

What are placeholder arrays and why they are useful (e.g., empty arrays, fixed shape arrays).

### ⏰ 1:06:14 np.arange()

Creating sequences with steps — like Python's `range()` but more powerful.

### ⏰ 1:13:05 np.linspace()

Creating evenly spaced numbers between two values.

### ⏰ 1:18:02 np.zeros()

Creating arrays filled with zeros — perfect for placeholders or model initialization.

### ⏰ 1:29:04 Important Array Methods in NumPy

Including methods like `reshape()`, `flatten()`, `astype()` etc.

### ⏰ 1:32:25 Array Attributes

Learn how to inspect properties of arrays:

* `.shape`
* `.size`
* `.dtype`
* `.T`

### ⏰ 1:38:17 Loading Data from CSV/Text Files

How to read external datasets into NumPy using:

```python
np.loadtxt(), np.genfromtxt()
```

### ⏰ 1:42:00 Sorting in NumPy

Sorting arrays in ascending or descending order using `np.sort()`.

### ⏰ 1:42:31 NumPy Array Manipulation

Operations like reshaping, stacking, splitting:

* `reshape()`
* `hstack()`, `vstack()`
* `split()`

### ⏰ 1:50:10 Indexing and Slicing in NumPy

How to extract specific elements, rows, or slices using indices.

### ⏰ 2:04:46 Broadcasting in NumPy

Powerful mechanism that allows NumPy to work with arrays of different shapes — a key feature.

### ⏰ 2:10:44 Filtering or Masking in NumPy

Applying conditions to extract specific data:

```python
arr[arr > 5]
```

### ⏰ 2:14:19 Arithmetic Operations

Element-wise operations:

* Addition
* Subtraction
* Multiplication
* Division
